# MIDI Master

## TODO

- Add EEPROM for storage
- Some controls should be in edit mode by default - like the patch select control (patch number).
This should be managed by the Page because the control itself can not know when other controls get focus/are selected.
- Realtime OutputName Ctrls (line 2) should be fixed and edited globally -not change with patch.
